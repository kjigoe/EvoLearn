# EvoLearn
First commit of EvoLearn to new GitHub account
This is an app I have been working on in collaboration with Josh Sharpe and Geoffrey Cook.
Josh was our main backend developer, I (Kevin) was the main front end developer, and Geoff was an additional programmer to work
on both front and backend when needed as well as testing on devices. All three of us worked on every aspect of the project though, to ensure we all learned the different methods of making a complete Android application.
